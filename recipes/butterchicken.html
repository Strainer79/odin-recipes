    <h2>This Indian dish is delicious and easy to cook</h2>
    <p>This crockpot butter chicken is one of my favorite Indian dishes. My friend made this dish for my family, and we were head over heels! I don't think I've had butter chicken that I've liked more.</p> 
    <p>It's wonderful to put it into the slow cooker in the morning and come home to the aroma of warm Indian spices... I love it! Serve with basmati rice and warm naan bread.</p>
