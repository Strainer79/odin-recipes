    <h2>Tasty oven baked Meat Pie</h2>
    <p>This meat pie recipe is delicious! I got it from my husband's mother. She is French so I believe this is a French meat pie. Beef, pork, and potato are all nicely spiced and baked together.</p>
    <p>It's yummy and pretty easy to make too! It's best served fresh, but you can also make it ahead and freeze or refrigerate it. Serve the pie by itself or with a beef gravy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium potato, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>⅓ clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place potato in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, mash, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, crumble ground beef and pork into a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic, mustard powder, thyme, sage, cloves, salt, and black pepper. Stir in water. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until meat is evenly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and mix in mashed potato.</li>
        <li>Ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate. Fill with meat mixture, then top with the remaining pie crust. Trim any excess dough, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. Prick top crust a few times with a knife to vent steam. Cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
