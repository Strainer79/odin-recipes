odin project assignment
In this project I will be learning and "mastering" html and perhaps little 
bit of css and jawa.
This is my first attempt to code a website, since the late 90s.
I hope after this project I will be comfortabel with the basic languages 
and commands.  
And to learn to use git/github effectively.
